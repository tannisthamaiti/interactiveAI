        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 1: The Cartoon Sorter üé®</h3>
            <p class="question-text">An animation studio has a library of 10,000 cartoon drawings. Each drawing is already labeled with the name of the character (e.g., 'Bugs Bunny', 'Mickey Mouse'). They want to train a computer program to automatically recognize and name the character in any new drawing they create. Is this an example of Supervised Learning?</p>
            <div class="options">
                <button data-correct="true" data-rationale="Correct! The program is learning from data that is already correctly labeled (each drawing has a character name). The goal is to predict the label for new, unseen data.">Yes</button>
                <button data-correct="false" data-rationale="Incorrect. This scenario uses pre-labeled data to train the model, which is the key characteristic of supervised learning, not unsupervised learning.">No</button>
            </div>
            <div class="hint-container">
                <button class="hint-button">Need a hint?</button>
                <div class="hint-text">Think about whether the computer is given the 'correct answers' to learn from at the beginning.</div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 2: The Score Predictor üéÆ</h3>
            <p class="question-text">A gaming company collects data from thousands of players, including hours played and levels completed. They want to build a model that can predict a new player's final score at the end of their first month. They use the historical data, which includes the final scores of all past players, to train the model. Is this an example of Supervised Learning?</p>
            <div class="options">
                <button data-correct="true" data-rationale="Correct! The model is trained on a dataset where the outcome (the final score) is already known. It learns the relationship between player actions and a specific, numerical target.">Yes</button>
                <button data-correct="false" data-rationale="Incorrect. Because the model is predicting a specific value (final score) based on data that already contains that value, it is a supervised task, specifically regression.">No</button>

            <h3>Question 3: The Jungle Camera üêÖ</h3>
            <p class="question-text">A wildlife conservation group sets up hundreds of hidden cameras in a jungle, capturing thousands of photos. They want a program to sort these photos into different groups based on visual similarities (e.g., animals with feathers, animals with fur). The program is not told beforehand what species exist or how many groups to create. Is this an example of Supervised Learning?</p>
            <div class="options">
                <button data-correct="false" data-rationale="Incorrect. The program is not given labeled examples to learn from; instead, it must find the patterns and create the groups on its own, which is an unsupervised task.">Yes</button>
                <button data-correct="true" data-rationale="Correct! The program is given unlabeled data (the photos) and asked to find its own structure by clustering similar images together. This is the definition of unsupervised learning.">No</button>

                <button class="hint-button">Need a hint?</button>

            <h3>Question 4: The Music Recommender üé∂</h3>
            <p class="question-text">A music streaming service analyzes your listening history and the histories of millions of other users. The algorithm then identifies large groups of users who have similar tastes in music and recommends songs to you that others in your group listen to. The system was never explicitly told 'what makes a good recommendation'. Is this an example of Supervised Learning?</p>
            <div class="options">
                <button data-correct="false" data-rationale="Incorrect. The algorithm is not trained on a dataset of 'correct recommendations.' It discovers clusters of users with similar tastes on its own, which is an unsupervised approach.">Yes</button>
                <button data-correct="true" data-rationale="Correct! This system works by finding hidden patterns and grouping similar users (clustering) without any pre-labeled data about what a 'good' recommendation is. It learns the structure of user preferences by itself.">No</button>
            </div>
            <div class="hint-container">
                <button class="hint-button">Need a hint?</button>

            <h3>Question 5: The Cheat Detector üïπÔ∏è</h3>
            <p class="question-text">Developers of an online game want to catch cheaters. Their system analyzes player behavior (speed, accuracy, etc.) to automatically flag players whose patterns are extremely different from the vast majority of normal players. The system doesn't use a pre-existing list of known cheaters to learn from. Is this an example of Supervised Learning?</p>
            <div class="options">
                <button data-correct="false" data-rationale="Incorrect. Since the system learns what 'normal' behavior looks like and flags deviations without a labeled dataset of 'cheaters' and 'non-cheaters,' it's an unsupervised task.">Yes</button>
                <button data-correct="true" data-rationale="Correct! This is a form of unsupervised learning called anomaly detection. The system identifies outliers that don't conform to the normal pattern, without being explicitly trained on what a 'cheater' looks like.">No</button>
            </div>
            <div class="hint-container">
                <button class="hint-button">Need a hint?</button>
                <div class="hint-text">Is the program looking for players who match a known 'cheater' profile, or is it just looking for anyone who acts unusually?</div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 6: The Animation Assistant ‚úçÔ∏è</h3>
            <p class="question-text">A company is developing a new animated movie. Animators create and label a few key frames in a scene (e.g., 'frame 1: start jump', 'frame 20: peak of jump'). Then, an AI uses this labeled information to automatically generate all the smooth, in-between animation frames. Is the AI's task an example of Supervised Learning?</p>
            <div class="options">
                <button data-correct="true" data-rationale="Correct! The AI is given a clear start point and a clear end point (the labeled key frames) and its goal is to predict the sequence of frames that fits between them. This is a complex form of regression, a supervised task.">Yes</button>
                <button data-correct="false" data-rationale="Incorrect. While the output is creative, the AI's task is guided by specific, labeled data points (the key frames). It's not discovering patterns on its own but rather filling in the blanks based on the examples it was given.">No</button>
