        <h1>Principles of Effective Prompting 🚀</h1>
        <h2>Principle 1: Write Clear and Specific Instructions</h2>
        <p>Use the following tactics to make your instructions to an AI unambiguous and more likely to produce the desired output.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Tactic 1: Use Delimiters</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input. Delimiters can be anything like: <code>```</code>, <code>"""</code>, <code>&lt; &gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tag&gt; &lt;/tag&gt;</code>, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Example (Python f-string):</strong> This shows how to structure a prompt that separates instructions from the text to be processed.</p>
            <pre><code>text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by 
providing instructions that are as clear and 
specific as you can possibly make them. 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity 
and context for the model, which can lead to 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""

prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```

        <button class="accordion">Tactic 2: Ask for Structured Output</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Request the output in a specific format like JSON or HTML. This makes the response predictable and easier to use in other programs or workflows.</p>
            <p><strong>Example (Python f-string):</strong></p>
            <pre><code>prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.

        <button class="accordion">Tactic 3: Check Whether Conditions Are Satisfied</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Ask the model to first verify if certain conditions are met before performing a task. This helps prevent incorrect responses based on flawed assumptions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 1 (Instructions Found):</strong> The model checks the text, finds instructions, and formats them as requested.</p>

Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some 
water boiling. While that's happening, 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious 
cup of tea to enjoy.

prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"

The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are 
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the 
trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People 
are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. 
Some are having picnics, while others are playing 
games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a 
perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the 
beauty of nature.

            <h2>Assignment: Mastering the Art of the Prompt ✍️</h2>
            <p>Your goal is to write four distinct prompts, each one demonstrating your understanding of a key tactic for clear and effective communication with an AI.</p>

            <h3>1. The Delimiter Challenge</h3>
            <p>Find a short paragraph of text from any source (a news article, a book, a website). Your task is to write a prompt that asks an AI to perform an action on this text.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> You must use <strong>delimiters</strong> (like <code>"""..."""</code> or <code>---...---</code>) to clearly separate your instructions from the text you want the AI to analyze.</li>
                <li><strong>Example Actions:</strong> Summarize the text, translate it, extract all the names of people, or change its tone from formal to casual.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Structured Output Challenge</h3>
            <p>Imagine you are building an application that needs data about a specific topic (e.g., planets, famous artists, types of cheese, car manufacturers).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Write a prompt that asks the AI to generate at least three examples of your chosen topic. You must specify that the output should be in <strong>JSON format</strong> and define the exact keys you want to see in the response (e.g., <code>name</code>, <code>discovery_date</code>, <code>mass</code>).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. The Conditional Challenge</h3>
            <p>Write a prompt that instructs an AI to analyze a piece of text and perform a different action based on what it finds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Your prompt must include a clear <strong>condition</strong>. For example, "If the following customer review is positive, write a cheerful thank you message. If it is negative, write a polite apology and ask for more details."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. The Style-Mimic Challenge (Few-shot)</h3>
            <p>Your task is to teach an AI a new, specific style of responding by giving it an example to follow.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Write a single prompt that includes at least one complete example of an input and the desired output style. Then, provide a new input and ask the AI to apply that same style.</li>
                <li><strong>Example Ideas:</strong> Teach it to turn movie titles into limericks, describe historical events like a pirate, or answer questions with another question.</li>
