    <h1>The Amazing Story of A.I. üß†</h1>
    <p>From a simple question to changing the world! Let's explore the incredible journey of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Part 1: The Spark of an Idea (1950s)</h2>
        <p>Long before smartphones, a brilliant mathematician named <strong>Alan Turing</strong> asked a powerful question: <strong>"Can machines think?"</strong></p>
        <p>He imagined a game called the "Imitation Game" (today known as the <strong>Turing Test</strong>). Imagine you're texting with two "people." One is a real person, and the other is a machine. If you can't tell which is which, the machine passes the test! This simple idea started the entire field of AI.</p>

    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Part 2: The Pioneers & Their Big Ideas (1980s-1990s)</h2>
        <p>After Turing, progress was slow. But a few smart scientists, often called the <strong>"Godfathers of AI,"</strong> kept working. Two of them were <strong>Geoffrey Hinton</strong> and <strong>Yann LeCun</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geoffrey Hinton</strong> helped figure out how to teach a computer to learn from its mistakes. The idea is called <strong>backpropagation</strong>. Think of it like learning to shoot a basketball. You shoot, miss, and your brain tells you, "That was too hard!" or "Aim a little left!" Backpropagation is how an AI adjusts its aim.</li>
            <li><strong>Yann LeCun</strong> invented a type of AI inspired by the human brain called a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong>. It's fantastic at understanding images! He used it to create <strong>LeNet-5</strong>, an AI that could read handwritten numbers on checks. ‚úçÔ∏è</li>

        <h2>Part 3: The "Big Bang" Moment (2012) üí•</h2>
        <p>For a long time, these ideas were cool but didn't work *that* well. Then, in 2012, everything changed. An AI named <strong>AlexNet</strong> (co-created by Geoffrey Hinton) blew everyone away in a huge image recognition contest.</p>
        <p>It was a "perfect storm" of three things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Super-Fast Computers:</strong> They used powerful computer chips from video games (<strong>GPUs</strong>) to train the AI super fast. üöÄ</li>
            <li><strong>A Giant Library of Pictures:</strong> A massive dataset called <strong>ImageNet</strong> gave the AI millions of labeled pictures to learn from.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart New Tricks:</strong> They used new algorithms that helped the AI learn more efficiently.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>AlexNet's success proved that Deep Learning was the future, and the modern AI boom began!</p>

        <h2>Part 4: The Game Changer (2015) üéÆ</h2>
        <p>AI could see, but could it *act*? A company called <strong>DeepMind</strong> decided to find out.</p>
        <p>They used a technique called <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>. Imagine training a puppy. When it does something good, you give it a treat. DeepMind's AI learned to play old Atari video games the same way. When it scored points, it got a "digital treat" (a reward). By playing thousands of times, it learned to become a master player, all by itself!</p>
        <p>This showed AI could learn to make smart decisions, not just recognize things.</p>

        <div class="quiz">
            <p>ü§î Quiz Time!</p>

        <h2>Part 5: How AI Started Affecting Our World üíº</h2>
        <p>As AI got smarter, it started changing the economy and jobs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Doing the Boring Stuff (Automation):</strong> Some repetitive jobs, like checking for mistakes on a factory line, could now be done by AI. This helped companies become faster and make fewer errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating Cool New Jobs:</strong> But AI also created brand new jobs that never existed before! People were needed to be <strong>AI Specialists</strong> (who design the AI), <strong>Data Scientists</strong> (who prepare the data it learns from), and many others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think about YouTube or Netflix recommendations. An AI suggests what you should watch next. That's a feature that created jobs for people who design and manage these AI systems. So, while some jobs changed, many new and exciting ones were born.</p>

        <div class="quiz">
            <p>ü§î Quiz Time!</p>
            <p>Does AI only take away jobs, or does it also help create new ones?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> It only takes away jobs.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b" id="correct5"> It helps create new jobs too.<br>
